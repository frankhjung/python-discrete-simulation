    "## Basics of SimPy\n",
    "\n",
    "[SimPy](https://simpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) is a process-based discrete-event simulation framework based on standard Python. It allows you to model real-world processes as a series of events that occur over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is composed of 4 main components:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Environment**: The core of the simulation that manages time and events.\n",
    "1. **Event**: Represents an occurrence that can happen at a specific time.\n",
    "1. **Process**: A sequence of events that represent the behavior of an entity in the  simulation.\n",
    "1. **Resource**: Represents limited resources that processes can request and release."

    "You'll notive that by introducing randomness, the simulation becomes more realistic. However, the ATM is not locked to a single customer at a time, allowing multiple customers to be served concurrently. This is not realistic for an ATM scenario, where typically only one customer can use the ATM at a time. To model this more accurately, we would need to introduce a resource that limits access to the ATM."
