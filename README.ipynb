    "These are my notes on the Udemy corse [Learn SimPy from Scratch](https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-simpy-from-scratch/) by [Mantic wise](https://www.udemy.com/user/manticwise/).\n",

    "\n",
    "[SimPy](https://simpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) is a process-based discrete-event simulation framework based on standard Python. It allows you to model real-world processes as a series of events that occur over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is composed of 4 main components:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Environment**: The core of the simulation that manages time and events.\n",
    "1. **Event**: Represents an occurrence that can happen at a specific time.\n",
    "1. **Process**: A sequence of events that represent the behavior of an entity in the  simulation.\n",
    "1. **Resource**: Represents limited resources that processes can request and release.\n",
